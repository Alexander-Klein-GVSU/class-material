# Piazza FAQ

**Q. What is Piazza?**

A.  An online Q&A forum designed specifically for teaching

**Q. Why are we using it?**

A. 1) get faster responses - get responses from both the instructor and students
   2) lets students benefit from others' questions - classmates
      may ask something you never even thought to ask
   3) removes barriers for students who may be shy or hesitant
      to actively participate - particularly important given the
      nature of participation in online classes
   4) provides a single, organized place for all course
      communication -- they are searchable, filterable, starrable, and persist
      throughout the semester and after it is over
   5) ensures all questions get answered satisfactorily -- unanswered
      and unresolved questions are clearly marked which prevents issues with emails
      getting lost or forgotten
   6) allows easy code and math formatting in questions and answers

**Q. Do I have to use it?**

A. Yes, Piazza is required.  Important announcements will be posted
   on Piazza and it is your responsibility to monitor Piazza for these
   announcements.  If you have a question/concern, please post on Piazza
   rather than emailing the professor to ensure you receive the fastest response.
   To make sure all students benefit equally, questions in emails may be
   redirected to be posted to Piazza.

**Q. How does it work?**

A. *Creating a post:*  Simply press "New Post" in the upper left,
   choose "question" if you want a response or "note" if no response needed
   (like posting a link to a resource you found helpful).
   Fill in the question title ("Summary") and full question text, and post!
   *Answering questions:* Select a question and edit or add the "Students" answer.
   *Followups:*" If a question is closely related, or you or another student want further
   clarification, post a followup below the question which can be answered with replies.
   *Email frequency:* In your settings, you can change how frequently you receive emails
   with the exception of some important instructor announcements which will spam out emails
   regardless of settings.

**Q. Should I post my question publicly?**

A. Yes -- in almost all cases.  Even if you don't think another student
   has the same question, please post publicly unless 1) it is about you specifically
   (illness, grades, etc) 2) it is **absolutely necessary** to post large chunks of
   code or solutions in order to ask your question (basically don't give away the answer).

**Q. What makes a good question?**

A. A good question is oen that clearly describes the issue
   (what the problem is or what you don't understand), what you have tried so far,
   and what you are currently thinking.  Without knowing what a student is
   thinking, it's hard to identify what they are misunderstanding.

**Q. Can we debug code via Piazza?**

A. That depends -- while Piazza is a fantastic resource, it is not always the best
   venue for helping students debug code and is not a complete substitute for
   office hours.  For instance, simply posting all of your code and asking
   what is wrong will likely be redirected to virtual office hours to walk
   through it together in a more back and forth conversation.
   On the other hand, Piazza can be great for going
   through and potentially correcting the general approach of a coded
   solution that you can describe in words.  It is also very appropriate
   if you can isolate the issue down to a few lines of code not behaving
   as anticipated.
